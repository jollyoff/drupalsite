# API Core Search Integration

This module provides a default setup for the Core Search, for searching
DocBlocks content.

By installing this module on your site, the required configuration will be set
up on the site.

Due to Drupal's configuration model, subsequent updates to the configuration
deployed with this module won't be applied to existing configuration.

The search view will be set up at this path: `/search/api`

You can view (and customize) the installed search configuration under these
paths:

- Search Page: `/admin/config/search/pages`
